                            HAN was born on September 14, 2000 in Incheon, South Korea. At the age of 9, he moved to Malaysia where he was home-schooled.[1]
                            He was influenced by hip-hop artists like Epik High and Zico to write songs, and became interested in singing when he heard Zion.T's "Two Melodies".[2]
                            At 16, he came back to South Korea to pass the Korean GED. He thought if he went back to Malaysia, he would never get the chance to become a singer,
                            so he made a deal with his parents that if he doesnâ€™t get into an agency within a year, he would go back to Malaysia to study.[3]
                            In late 2019, JYP Entertainment stated that HAN suffers from intermittent anxiety around an undetermined number of people.[4]
                            He is currently enrolled at Gukje Cyber University under the Department of Entertainment Studies.[5]

                            Han Jisung and his friend auditioned for a company one morning, and heard about a monthly JYP audition taking place as well. They went there to see if they could spot a celebrity, 
                            but eventually, Jisung participated in the audition and passed with rapping.[6] He joined the company a few days after passing the Korean GED, then started training at D.E.F. Academy[7].
                            In late 2016, he formed a hip hop crew called 3RACHA with members Bang Chan (CB97) and Changbin (SPEARB), where he used the stage name "J.ONE". They uploaded self-composed extended plays on SoundCloud throughout 2017.
                            His individual picture and name were officially revealed by the company on October 13, 2017 at noon, for his participation in the upcoming survival show Stray Kids.[8] He was introduced with the roles "Rap", "Vocal" and
                            "Producing". On the final episode of the show on December 19, 2017, it was confirmed that Jisung would debut with the boy group Stray Kids.
